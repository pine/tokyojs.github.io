### Who can submit talks to TokyoJS?
Everyone. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or you're looking to hold your first talk: we want to hear what you're excited about.

### What would be good talk topics?
A non-comprehensive list:

* A new JavaScript framework you discovered, or made
* An interesting problem you solved with JavaScript
* How you test, deploy and manage your JavaScript
* Upcoming changes in the ECMA spec

### How do I submit talks to TokyoJS?
Create a new issue [here](https://github.com/tokyojs/tokyojs.github.io/issues). If you don't know how to create an issue 
take a look at some of the open issues tagged "Speaker Registration" or take a look at the [sample issue](https://github.com/tokyojs/tokyojs.github.io/issues/3). 

We go through the list roughly 2 weeks before the meet-up, and will 
generally choose topics that create a diverse as possible evening of talks. 
This means that if your talk is not selected for this meetup, you'll probably be selected for the next meetup.
